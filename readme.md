# Project Overview

## Implementation

Parser parses all new articles from base url's, language model generates an overview of all these articles, and a web based frontend (not yet existing) displays these and can also request new overviews with news sites as input.

## Status

Cecause my pc can't handle large language models this project is paused for now.
